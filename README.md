## Introduction

Food & Resource Sharing Platform is an application that allows users to post surplus food, clothes, or resources they no longer need to a dashboard. Others nearby can then claim them — creating a mini Craigslist for survival needs. This will help reduce waste, fight poverty, and strengthen local community support networks by making sharing easier, faster, and more transparent.
